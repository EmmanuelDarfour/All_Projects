Biodiversity Index (BI) Prediction project
In this project, a dataset containing factors that influence 
biodiversity index is used in a multiple linear regression (OLS) 
to assess the effect of each factor on biodiversity index while 
checking to reduce multicollinearity. The statistically 
significant features (p=0.05) were deforestation_rate, 
protected_areas and forest_coverage. Counter-intuitively, the model
results showed that deforestation_rate had a positive effect on 
BI while protected_areas and forest_coverage had a negative effect
on BI. 




Estimation on Water Use Project
This project involved analysing access to water in the
national, urban and rural populations of 213 countries in
2020 from the United Nations Estimates on Water Use
dataset. The access to water was categorised into four
levels of quality–basic, limited, unimproved and
surface. At the national level, about two-thirds of the
populations had 75% and above access to basic level
water services.
