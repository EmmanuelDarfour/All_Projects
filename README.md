Biodiversity Index (BI) Prediction Project:
In this project, a dataset containing factors that influence 
biodiversity index is used in a multiple linear regression (OLS) 
to assess the effect of each factor on biodiversity index while 
checking to reduce multicollinearity. The statistically 
significant features (p=0.05) were deforestation_rate, 
protected_areas and forest_coverage. Counter-intuitively, the model
results showed that deforestation_rate had a positive effect on 
BI while protected_areas and forest_coverage had a negative effect
on BI. 

Determining Effect of Car Features on Fuel Efficiency: In this project, 
I run a multiple linear regression (OLS) model on a dataset to determine how
each predictor variable influences fuel efficiency. The variables having most 
effect on mpg are wt and am, followed qsec and gear. 





Estimation on Water Use Project:
This project involved analysing access to water in the
national, urban and rural populations of 213 countries in
2020 from the United Nations Estimates on Water Use
dataset. The access to water was categorised into four
levels of qualityâ€“basic, limited, unimproved and
surface. At the national level, about two-thirds of the
populations had 75% and above access to basic level
water services.
